# Reliquary
Your daily dose of adventure!

Reliquary is a text adventure game heavily based on a browser game from the early 2000s called Dragon Court. As an adventurer, you have a certain number of daily "ventures," which you can spend to fight monsters, travel across a fantasy world, and encounter all kinds of interesting locations and NPCs. When you run out of ventures, you must rest for the day. But come tomorrow, you will be refreshed and ready to adventure again!

As you grow in experience points and levels, you grow in power and intelligence, gain more ventures each morning, and gain access to more challenging and rewarding areas across the realm, as well as powerful artifacts dropped by even more menacing creatures! As time passes in the real world, your character goes on to live a dynamic daily life!
